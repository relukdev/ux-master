## 🛑 The Real Problem

You have a great idea. You describe it to your AI tool. But the UI it generates is... **ugly**. 
It looks generic, "AI-made," and lacks a cohesive design system. Forms are too long, buttons are too small, and the user experience is frustrating. 

This is the reality 90% of founders, developers, and PMs face. Great code with an ugly UI equals a dead product.

## ✨ The Magic Solution

**MasterDesign Agent** turns any AI coding tool into a **professional design studio**. 
It works silently in the background of your favorite IDE or CLI. You just speak your ideas, and the AI automatically applies world-class design standards.

| ❌ Without MasterDesign Agent | ✦ With MasterDesign Agent |
|---------------------|--------------|
| AI generates generic, "AI-made" UI | Studio-quality UI that WOWs customers |
| Inconsistent spacing and colors | Cohesive, professional design system |
| Tiny buttons, maze-like menus | Optimized with 48 scientific UX Laws |
| No automated quality checks | 37 automated Design Tests |
| Hire a designer: $3K–$15K, wait weeks | **$0, results in 60 seconds** |

## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

We've massively upgraded the toolkit to give you unprecedented power over design systems:

- 🧬 **Harvester v3 (Comprehensive Extraction):** Extract 50-80+ design tokens from any website. Captures color histograms, semantic colors, neutral scales, typography scales, spacing, and layout metrics. Instantly copy the "DNA" of top-tier sites.
- 🗂️ **Project Registry:** Manage multiple design system projects effortlessly. Merge harvests from multiple pages into a single cohesive project.
- 📖 **Design Doc Generator:** Automatically generate beautiful HTML documentation for your extracted design systems (color swatches, typography specimens, component samples).
- 🔗 **Token Mapper & Semi MCP Bridge:** Map design tokens directly to Semi Design UI variables. Generate CSS overrides, Figma-ready JSON, and React component templates programmatically.
- 🧪 **Comprehensive 7 Test Suites:** Full TDD for Design coverage with pass/fail criteria.

## 🧠 Complete Design Intelligence

MasterDesign Agent isn't just a template. It's a vast intelligence matrix containing **838+ design rules** mapped across **13 tech stacks** and **13 industries** (Fintech, SaaS, E-commerce, etc.).

- **67 UI Styles:** From Glassmorphism to Brutalism.
- **96 Color Palettes & 57 Font Pairings:** Hand-picked for maximum aesthetic impact.
- **48 UX Laws:** Automatically applies Hick's Law (reduce choices), Fitts's Law (larger touch targets), Doherty Threshold (fast feedback), and more.
- **37 Design Tests:** Acts as a strict QA filter before the AI finishes generating code.
